# Matters Editor

This rich text editor is based on three amazing projects [Quill](https://quilljs.com/), [reac-quill](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill) and [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/). This editor has been used in a real production called [Matters](http://matters.news), a writing platform built on top of IPFS. Currently, we're pulling it out as a standalone package, so there will be some big changes in the following. 😎
